Competed in the Big Data contest organized by Tata Consulting Services, where participants were ask to build a mobile application that  searches, collects, and presents free content from various sources on the web to users of our app. </br>
For the contest, I created WatNews, a mobile application that pulls data from the University of Waterlooâ€™s Open Data API and aggregates the data to build a responsive cross-platform (ios/android) mobile application. The application gives users the ability to access the latest news headlines and articles from the University of Waterloo in the palm of their hand. Application built using C++ and the Qt framework. 


<h2> Setup: </h2>
1) Install QT Creator. </br> 
2) Open .pro file (it should automatically open in QT). </br> 
3) Download a mobile emulator kit (android or iphone). </br> 
4) Choose the emulator kit in QT and run the app. </br>
